For this proble, I created three tables with the following schema:

incidents: Auto-incrementing integer id (primary key), zipcode
zipBoroughs: Auto-incrementing integer id (primary key), zipcode, borough name
zipcodes: Auto-incrementing integer id (primary key), zipcode, area, population

The incidents table simply lists all zipcodes of incidents, therefore making it possible to count t
hem.
The zipBoroughs table matches a zipcode to its boroguh.
The zipcodes table simply lists all zipcodes and their area and population to get the density.

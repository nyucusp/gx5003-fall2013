#Alex Chohlas-Wood (acw438). Assignment 1, Report.

The incidents file required the greatest amount of cleaning. I
processed each address before adding it to the database, condensing
full postal terms (like street) into corresponding abbreviations
(ST). Particular trouble occurred with the directional abbreviations,
like SW, but I think I caught most of these. I also eliminated double
spaces and surrounded the address in double quotes (") so MySQL could
process addresses with apostrophes.

I assumed the "Unique Key" column actually signified the number of
incidents at that address. If an address already existed in the table,
I added the number of incidents together. I completely excluded
erroneous data of two kinds: those entries with a blank zipcode, and
those entries with non-numeric zipcodes. A sample of these data are
shown below.

The other two tables were uniquely keyed by the five-digit zipcode,
which ignored detail on the nine-digit zipcode level. I set these as
Varchar(5) to accomodate zipcodes ending in HH. These zipcodes are a
census accounting trick and probably won't figure into our analysis,
but I kept them anyway.  I also kept track of duplicates in all three
tables in a "records" column, which counted how many separate entries
there were in the original data.

For area and population data, my biggest assumption was that
duplicate zipcode entries each signified a unique subset of that
zipcode. If I found a duplicate, I added its area and population (only
if not null) to the existing entry. I justified this by comparing my
results to online zipcode population data, which largely matched
perfectly the results of summing population.  

I also set the zipcode area as a DOUBLE type, since many of the areas
were extremely small and seemingly vulnerable to floating-point
inaccuracies (this is probably overkill, but I did it anyway).

For the boroughs file, I simply transferred the data to MySQL. Oddly,
this file had one duplicate of every record. These duplicates were
ignored but noted in the "records" column. Also, this file is missing
a few big zipcodes, including 10065 and 10075 in Manhattan. I did not
attempt to correct these missing tuples.

Other notes: If the assignment did not require a database table for
each of the imported tables, I would have combined the Boroughs data
with the Population and Area table. Future analysis might also read
addresses with missing zipcodes, assign the correct zips, and include
them in the total counts; however, this is beyond the scope of this
assignment.


# SAMPLE of erroneous tuples from Incident table:
Empty zipcodes:
['CROTONA PARK', '', '16']
['RED HOOK PARK COFFEY PLGD', '', '7']
['', '', '323522'] <-- This is probably a bin for all the complaints 
     	 	       with no address. Lots of them!
['RED HOOK RECREATION AREA', '', '28']
['PARK LA S', '', '1']
['241 ST', '', '1']
['FLUSHING MEADOWS PARK', '', '176']
Non-numeric/incomplete zipcode:
['16 CENTRAL AVENUE', 'NA', '1']
['UNKNOWN UNKNOWN', 'N/A', '1']
['16 CENTRAL AVENUE', 'N/A', '1']
['6910 OWENSMOUTH AVE', 'N/A', '1']
['P.O BOX 157', '4009-0517', '1']
['NA NAN', 'NA', '1']
['123 POPLAR ST', 'N/A', '1']
['N/A PELHAM PARKWAY SOUTH', 'N/A', '1']
['AIRPORT AIRPORT', '?', '1']

I decided not to filter the data in python, and created the tables as exact copies of the data present in the csv files.

Using MySQL to filter through the data was much more convenient. It only took about a minute to create the tables (compared to much longer wait times for friends).
With MySQL, it was also possible to ignore the tuples with incorrect/missing data by making the appropriate additions the query.
Duplicates were handled by using "select distinct".

I'm assuming that my numbers for the queries assigned are correct, as I did not get a chance to compare results with friends.
In problem 6, all the zip codes in Manhattan where incidents have occurred have been listed, even if the population is unavailable/missing.

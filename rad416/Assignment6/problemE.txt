With more time/resources/data, I'd work on first trying out different algorithms, as well as gathering other attributes for the zipcodes.  
I'd also take the analysis below the zipcode level (or actually zip code tabulation area) to the census tract level to get greater resolution on the areas in question.  
While this would increase the size of the dataset, it would also give me the chance to better characterize the individual areas.  
Merged with the attributes from the 2010 Census and 2011 5-year American Community Survey, there could be some interesting trends that would emerge from this more nuanced analysis of the available data. 
More granular data from the ACS or other demographic data sources could provide attributes with greater correlation to the number of incidents.  
Data with a higher correlation would have greater predictive power with regarded to the unlabeled data set.

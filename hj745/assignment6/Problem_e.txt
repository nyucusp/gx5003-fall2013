I expect to achieve with this model on the unlabeled data with relatively higher than that of labeled data. This is because if I can use more data in making the best OLS model, I can make more accurate model with smaller RMSE. In this light, unlabeled dataset has 114 rows that are fewer data than labeled data that has 300 rows  so that I can expect to get a model with much larger RMSE on unlabeled data. 
In order to improve RMSE on unlabeled data, more data, which can be used for training dataset for K-fold cross validation, are required to make statistically more significant model with lower RMSE value.

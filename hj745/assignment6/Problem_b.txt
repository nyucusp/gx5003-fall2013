I selected 5th order of degree for the following reasons. 
First, by looking at the 'Problem_b_figure_5.png', average RMSE is the lowest at the degree of fit of 5th order. 
Second, by looking at the output (Problem_b_output_capture.png) of Problem_b.py, I found that the 5th order of degree shows the largest R-square value of   0.64448

In the 'Problem_c_figure_1.png' which contains from the RMSE on the whole training set, I found that RMSE for cross-validation and training are relatively low and went to plateau after the degree of 2nd order. Thus, it's quite hard to select the optimal degree of fit for the model. 
On the other hand, I was able to find distinctive point of lowest average RMSE in the 'Problem_c_figure_2.png', which was derived from the 10-fold CV average. The optimal degree of fit for the model was 5th order obviously.

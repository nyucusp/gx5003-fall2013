I used Pandas for the Exercise 1 because it  has proven very successful as a tool for working with time series data, especially in the financial data analysis space. With the Problem (b) and (c) in the Exercise 1, I got to know that each gave me distinctive and unique insight respectively. 
For example, the output of  Problem(b) was derived by using superposition. So, I was able to see holistic pattern of Apple and Microsoft over time, comparing their stocks as a whole.

On the other hand, in the Problem (c), I was able to find new insight over the detailed pattern of each company, especially Microsoft's, which was not discovered in the Problem (b). That is, it was hard to notice that Microsoft shows similar patter in stocks as Apple by just looking at the figure derived from Problem (b), using superposition. However, by using juxtaposition, I was able to find detailed Microsoft's pattern, comparing to Apples in a different scale of Y axis, which is the stock price.

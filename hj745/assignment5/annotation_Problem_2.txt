(1)I used SQL query to make the histogram of total number of submission in each day. This is because it is one of the easiest way to make the result by using 'Group By' query.
Also, when it comes to the number of bins, I set the total number of bins is equal to the total number of days in the given period in the timestamp data file. This is because I thought that the total number of submission in one day can provide me detailed information about the distinctive pattern of submission related to assignment due date. To be specific, I can see changes in total number of actions in one day by making the number of bins equal to the number of days in the data file.  

(2) I guess that the amount of work (number of actions) for the different assignments can give me an important information that more difficult students have, the more submission they make. That is, by looking at patterns in histogram, there is a distinctive bin in the middle of the output image and I can guess that the assignment that has a due on that day would be the most difficult one so that the students made a lot of actions for it. 

(3)Actually, by looking at the pattern in the output image file, I can find out the prominent pattern that the number of actions has been gradually increasing just before tha due date and it goes to the top in the due date. Then the number of actions drops significantly to almost zero and then rise again about one week before the due date.

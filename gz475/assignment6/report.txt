Problem a. from the population vs incidents, and zipcode vs incidents plottings, we can see that there are a lot of zipcodes
have low incident number, and these zipcodes are mainly outside the New York City. After deleting the data with low 
incidents, we can see a more clear relationship between population and incident number.

Problem b: the 3th order 10-fold CV model has the lowest RMSE, although sometimes the R^2 is not the biggest (depending on
the folds created by the program).

Problem c: the 5th order model without CV has the minimum RMSE, which might be a sign of overfitting.

Problem d: to avoid potential overfitting, I choose the 3th order model and the whole data as my training database to do 
the prediction work.

Problem e: the expected RMSE would be around 13000 as shown in the plotting of Problem c. If there's more time, I might be
able to separate the zipcodes in and out New York City, find more fit model for each part.

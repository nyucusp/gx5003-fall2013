Problem a. from the population vs incident, and zipcode vs incidents plots, we can see that there are a lot of zipcodes 
have no incident, and these zipcodes are mainly outside New York City. After delete the data with low incidents, we can
see a more linear like relationship between population and incident number.

Problem b: the 3th order 10-fold CV model has the lowest RMSE, although sometimes the R^2 is not the biggest (depens on the
folds created by the program).

Problem c: the 5th order model without CV has the minimum RMSE, which might be a sign of overfitting.

Problem d: to avoid potential overfit, I choose 3th order model to do the prediction work.

Problem e: the expected RMSE would be around 13000 as shown in the plotting of Problem c. If there's more time, I might be
able to separate the zipcodes in and out New York City, find more fit model for each part.

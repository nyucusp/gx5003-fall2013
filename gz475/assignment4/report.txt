Gang Zhao, Assignment 4, Report
Problem 1, to deal with problem 2-6 , the three tables created as following:
	   drop former tables named boroughs, zipcodes and incidents;
	   boroughs: use zipcode and borough data in boroughs.csv, but delete the duplicate records;
	   zipcodes: use zipcode, area and population data in zipCodes.csv, but delete the records without population number;
	   incidents: use all the data in Incidents_grouped_by_Address_and_Zip.csv, and Unique Key column is considered as the number of incidents with the address.
Problem 2, the input format should be "python problem2.py *";
	   if there's no record in zipcodes table returns "None";
	   if one zipcode have more than one records in table, caculate the population density separately, for example 10504;
	   query of 6390 should be 06390.
Problem 3, the imput format should be "python problem3.py *";
	   if there's no match borough returns "None"; 
	   the incidents without detailed addresses but have zipcodes data are also considered when cacualte the sum, but the ones have no zipcodes are not included.
Problem 4, the incidents without detailed addresses are not printed. 
Problem 5, the incidents without detailed addresses are not printed. 
Problem 6, use simple query without complicated syntaxes.

a. From plotting the data, with population vs the number of incidents,
it is clear that the data could be represented linearly. There are two observable features that could
interfere with this, however:
    1) as the poplation increases, the standard deviation also seems to increase
    2) There are a significant amount of near-zero values that do not correspond to the line produced.


b. I allow the cross-validations to choose the mode based on the results of the RSME and R^2s.
    I use the argmin of the RMSE's for each fold chose, and the argmax of the R^2s, and then
    take the mode of these across all of the fold runs. So far this has returned orders of 1 and 4
    for the conclusions, with it tending towards 1, but occasionally returning 4. There is a noticable
    decrease/increase in the RMSE/R^2 at order 4 for these models, and there are frequent occurences
    of 4s for individual sets of folds, but on most runs, the mode of the results still gives an order 1
    model for the results.

c. The RMSE for the whole dataset lines up nicely with the average RMSE from the model that was
    selected. (Over several runs, however, order 4 was selected serveral times; it still corresponded
    well with that, although in general there were more order 1's.). The standard deviations for the
    chosen order fit nicely around the RMSE for the whole dataset, and tend not to include it so well
    for the other orders. Order 5 is always way higher in RMSE than every other one.

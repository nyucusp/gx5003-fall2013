Using the scatterplots I generated for problem A,
one can notice an obvious positive correlation between the 
population of an area and the number of incidents reported.
It seems like most of these incidents take place in zipcodes
10000 to 12000, these also happen to have the highest concentration
of people as shown by the zip vs population plot.

After a bit of research, I found that NYC zipcodes
are only in the range of 10000 to 12000 which means this dataset
has some incorrect reportings or has reportings from outside of the
5 boroughs.

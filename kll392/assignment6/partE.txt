I do not expect very good performance with this model on the unlabeled data, mostly because I saw very large RMSE values when creating the model in the first place.  The data I used to test the model was extremely varied and although the model I ended up working with fit the best, it was by no means a perfect fit and there were many points that fell very far from the OLS curve.  I anticipate an RMSE on the order of 14,000 because that is what I saw with my test data.  If I had more time and data available, I think I could greatly improve this model by splitting the data up into the two groups that seem relatively well defined: those areas where population does have an effect on the number of incidents, and those areas where it seems to be unrelated.  This goes back to my initial analysis of the data in part a of this assignment.  If I could split the data into those two groups and create two separate models, I would be able to come up with much more accurate predictions across the board.  The presence of a large amount of essentially zero entries throughout the dataset definitely skews the curve from fitting the data scattered in the upper part of the graph.
